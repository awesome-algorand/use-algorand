## Status After Block

Let's look at the preview on the bottom right, we'll notice that it is not displaying anything.
This is because we haven't yet implemented the `useWaitForBlock` hook in our React application.

To address this, we'll call the `useWaitForBlock` hook to handle the fetch call in the editor on the top right.


```tsx add={5}
import {useWaitForBlock} from '@awesome-algorand/react-query'

export function WaitForBlockViewer(){
    const data = {round: 1}
    const query = useWaitForBlock(data)

    if(query.isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>
    if(query.isError) return <div>Error: {query.error.message}</div>

    return (
        <div>
            <h2>Time Since Last Round: {query.data["time-since-last-round"]}</h2>
            <h2>Last Round: {query.data["last-round"]}</h2>
        </div>
    )
}
```
